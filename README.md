##  E-Commerce SQL Case Study
###  Project Overview

This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset using SQL to understand user behavior, conversion funnel performance, revenue drivers, and business growth trends.
The goal is to convert raw event-level data into clear, actionable business insights.

##  Business Questions Answered

How has website traffic grown over time?

Which pages and landing pages drive the most engagement?

Where do users drop off in the purchase funnel?

How efficient is session → order conversion?

Which products generate the most revenue and profit?

How do new users vs repeat users behave?

Which marketing channels perform best?

What is the impact of refunds on revenue?

How do monthly trends evolve across traffic, orders, and revenue?

How does device type (desktop vs mobile) affect conversion?

##  Key Insights
